## HTTP service for Endocode challenge

This repository is used to go throught some challenge steps. General idea is to create a HTTP service, that will have three endpoints:

```
* /helloworld
* /helloworld?name=AlfredENeumann
* /versionz 
```

The app expected to be stored in a Docker image. Deployment happening through pipeline with Jenkins.
